CAN
Q1:
The CAN bus protocol offers a robust networking solution with inbuilt error
handling. It offers flexible connection, as it is multi-nodal and not point to
point. 

CAN VS SPI:
    - CAN is more suitable for this project as it is multi nodal, instead of
      SPI's point to point connection 
    - SPI is unsuitable for long distance connections, often only existing on
      the same pcb. CAN on the other hand excels at long distance
      communication. 
    - CAN is more reliable as it is less susceptible to noise, whereas SPI is
      very susceptible to noise/interference. 

CAN VS USB: 
    - CAN is much easier to wire than USB. CAN_H and CAN_L vs USB's P, D+, D-,
      and G.
    - USB only supports short distances ~= 5 meters.
    - USB is only point to point. 

CAN VS PCIe:
    - Little tolerance for transmission errors, because it it not built for
      communication over long distances.
    - Also only point to point connections.


Q2:
Redback may choose to use the CAN bus protocol, as it is suitable for real-time
applications such as vehicles. The CAN bus protocol also offers multi-node
connections, which is suitable for a project like redback racing as there are
many components that make up a car. CAN is also very robust, offering in built
error checking, confinement, and differential signalling. CAN is also easier to
wire, as it is not point to point.

STM32 Chip Selection

I have chosen the STM32F779NI.

found here:
    https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f779ni.html#st_description_sec-nav-tab

I have chosen it because it meets all the requirements.
It has Ethernet support, 3 A/D converters, it has USB support, it includes 12
16-bit timers AND 2 32 bit timers, 2048kB of flash size, and 3 CAN 2.0 buses.

This chip just meets requirements, and does not exceed it.

It requires 1.7v to 3.6v of power
It is 13mmx13mmx1.2mm in size.

From digikey.com it is $38.67 AUD excluding shipping for a single unit. They
offer bulk pricing though and free shipping over $60 AUD (10 units at $31.0570
AUD, 25 units for $29.1532, etc.)  

From STMicroelectronics it is $20.84 USD which is roughly $31.65 AUD excluding
shipping. With shipping from STMicroelectronics is $26.83 USD which is $40.72
AUD.
